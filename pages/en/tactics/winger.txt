====== Winger ======

{{ :en:tactics:lwrwzones.png?200|}}

**Without the ball:**
  *Doesn't take part in build-up play
  *Stays wide in A (LW) or E (RW) and on one line with the opponent's defense  
  *Once we have the ball in line 4 or 5, RW and LW have more freedom running diagonally towards the goal to get through balls
  *To prevent that ST/LW/RW don't get in each other's way inside the box, LW should move in B6 and RW in D6
  *Always try to be ready for switches of play from the other side...
  *...maybe even for long through balls, even if they don't come to you often, at least show that you are always ready
  *Don't run back or to the other side to get the ball, since it will slow down build-up and make it harder to get forward

**With the ball:**
  *Your main job is to get behind der defense by either one-two's or 1on1-dribblings
  *Keep in mind, that going into dribblings before line 5 is too risky and frustrating for teammates if you lose the ball like that
  *If you get the ball in line 5 you can and must be creative and therefore have more freedom on the ball
  *E.g. the RW can dribble from E5 to D4 and then either shoot or assist someone else
  *Having the ball in E6 or A6 should be rare, since you can easily get isolated and the only two things you can effectively do is either cross or pass back to line 5

===== Just a Dummy? =====

Playing on the wing in Positional Play sounds too simple and extremely boring at first. There is actually only one side that you can play to compared to the complexity of the center and halfspaces.

To be more precise, the RW only has the left side to play to, since there is the sideline on the right. There is no "F" line, ofcourse. But it is not quite as easy as it sounds.

It is very easy to isolate wingers on the wing, which is a common way in defending. E.g. the LW gets the ball in A4 and the opponent's RW/RCM/RB attack him instantly. If the LW can't shield the ball or doesn't make a smart pass, he will most likely lose the ball.

This is one of the reasons, why the wings in Positional Play are called "Low priority zone" and LW/RW should very rarely get the ball before Line 5. The only effective thing they can do before line 5 without losing the ball or interrupting build-up play, is passing back directly. 

This doesn't help the team moving forward and is only raising the passes/touches statistics for that winger. And if he loses the ball unnecessarily, it shows even more, how redundant it is to pass to the wing in lines 1-4.

The only reason to pass to the wing there is by switches of play from e.g. B3 to E4.

===== Freedom (?) =====

Playing as a winger is alot more restricted to rules and does not have much to do - until the "Freedom zone".

The "Freedom zone" is basically Line 5 and 6. There you have much more freedom in your dribblings and movements, by still keeping some kind of structure. Keeping the structure intact will always be very important e.g. to avoid teammates standing and running in each other's way or even "covering" each other.

This structure can easily be kept alive if LW limits his runs to B6 (sometimes B5) and RW to D6 (sometimes D5).

That freedom we are talking about rather refers to dribblings: The wingers are the only ones in attack who are allowed to (almost) constantly make feints, skill moves and sprints into the box (both with and without the ball).

I call the dribbling I will refer to "Halfspace-dribbling". That means dribbling diagonally inside from A/E to B/D.

===== Halfspace-Dribbling =====

Example: Dribbling diagonally inside from E5 to D6 will give the RW following options, while green arrows are possible pass directions and black arrows are runs from teammates:
{{ :en:tactics:rwhsd.png?250|}}

  *Short (L1+)X-pass to the RCM in D5, which could make a one-two possible to get behind defense((RW passes to RCM, then runs towards D6, RCM makes through ball.))
  *Short (or "medium") X-pass to LCM in C5, which makes other options possible
  *Short through ball towards E6, if the RB is overlapping
  *Long (lobbed) through ball towards B6 if LW is ready for it
  *Short diagonal through ball towards C6 to assist the ST
  *Or just finish yourself or dribble further inside the box and assist/finish there

~~CLEARFLOAT~~

One of these options will always work and it is your decision to choose the right option. There are more than enough to choose from. See the freedom now?

But the more your teammates are out of position and break the structure, options will be taken away from you. The same counts for you, too, ofcourse, so I hope you will see how important it is for us, that you as winger stay wide and don't interrupt the build-up until the freedom zone has been reached.

Each option stated in the example above can be seen in this video. While Barcelona's playstyle has changed over the past 4 years, which explains much earlier through balls from lower areas, many things still stayed the same.
