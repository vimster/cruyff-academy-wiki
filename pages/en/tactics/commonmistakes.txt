Here all players make overlapping runs. The ST becomes playmaker and has no back pass options. A counter attack can't be prevented.

In this situation the RCM has no vertical passing options after his dribbling. A back pass to the CDM is the only resonable option, as the CDM has the time to reassess the situation. Besides both wingers should have stayed in A and E respectively.
