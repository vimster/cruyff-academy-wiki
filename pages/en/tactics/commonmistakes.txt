===== Overlapping =====

Here all players make overlapping runs. The ST becomes playmaker and has no back pass options. A counter attack can't be prevented.

===== Ignoring the pivot =====

In this situation the RCM has no vertical passing options after his dribbling. A back pass to the CDM is the only resonable option, as the CDM has the time to reassess the situation.

Also, the right winger should have stayed in E and the LCM is overlapping instead of providing a passing option. Here, he //must// stand still in B4 and wait for an easy pass.

In the end, the RCM gets isolated by himself but also by his teammates decisions.

By the way: The LW should have stayed in A but is controlled by AI.
