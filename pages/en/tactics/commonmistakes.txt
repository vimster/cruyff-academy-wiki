====== Common mistakes ======

===== Positioning: Unoccupied zones  =====

{{ :en:tactics:game_001_01.jpg |}}

In this situation only 4 vertical lanes are occupied (B-E). In Positional Play every vertical lane has to
be occupied by at least one player.
===== Massive Overlapping =====

Here all players make overlapping runs. The ST becomes playmaker and has no back pass options. A counter attack can't be prevented.

===== Ignoring the pivot =====

<html><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LBq8OiZXgAI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></html>

In this situation the RCM has no vertical passing options after his halfspace dribbling. A back pass to the CDM is the only resonable option, as the CDM has the time to reassess the situation.

Also, the right winger should have stayed in E and the LCM is overlapping instead of providing a passing option. Here, he //must// stand still in C4 and wait for an easy pass.

In the end, the RCM gets isolated by himself but also by his teammates decisions.

By the way: The LW should have stayed in A but is controlled by AI.

===== Build-up without progress =====

<html><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tBIkB5juydg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></html>

We constantly observe that our possession distribution isn't optimal, yet. Sometimes we get the following distribution out of 75-80% possession: 1. 3rd: 30%; 2. 3rd: 40%; 3. 3rd: 5-10%. A striven distribution should look like this 10%-40%-25%.

In this situation both CMs withdraw and provide short passing options. That results in 8 players in the 1st and 2nd line (GK, back of 4, CDM, 2 CMs). The opponent is pressing frantically in C2-D4 with 6 players. 
There are 5 vertical lanes (A-E) in Positional Play. Ideally each lane is occupied by one player between opponents defensive line and midfield. (LW: A3-4; LCM: B3; ST: C3-4; RCM: D3; RW: E3-4). We have to trust the CDM, GK and 2 CBs to resist opponents pressing and verticalize into proper zones. Therefore they need options in 3rd and 4th line. Thus, LCM could occupy B3 to overcome their pressing.


===== Skill-moves in build-up phase =====

In general skill moves like scoop turns in build-up phase are evil. If you are not 95% certain that the move will work out, better avoid it, especially when there are simple passing options available.


===== Horizontal switch of play from A or E =====

In this scene at 0:07 the RB gets pressed in E4. The pass options to CDM, RCB and RCM are closed down.
The RB tries to switch to A, which results in a turnover. Remember: a switch of play has to be conducted
by a CB, CDM, GK from B,C or D.
The right decision at 0:07 would have been a lob pass to the LCB in C3. After receiving the ball, the LCB has the entire field in front of him.


===== Not holding L2 as pass receiver =====

This scene shows what happens when the pass receiver is on the move and does not hold L2 whilst expecting X-passes.
Why it is important to hold L2?

  * You face the ball carrier, no matter what direction you are moving
  * You can move away from the opponent in a controlled manner
  * You signal the ball carrier that you demand a X-pass
  * The ball can be controlled more quickly
  * The probability of a successful pass increases

===== Interrupting the rythmn of passing =====

===== Not prepared for counter attacks in final third =====

<html><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pYuSHDX7exY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></html>

Here we can observe a congestion in C6. Neither a proper staggering inside the box nor the prepartion for a counter attack is fulfilled. At 0:10 B5, C5 and D5 should have been occupied, instead.

===== Turning into the opponent =====

<html><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F3XftleF9No" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></html>

Receiving a pass and turning into the opponent should be avoided. Imagine the opponents are incarnations of Medusa. Don't look into
their eyes. Move away, pass backwards, shield the ball with L2 (with pushing the left stick to the opponent player) , but don't turn around.

===== Neglecting the space between the lines =====
