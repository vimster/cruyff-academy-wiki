===== Overlapping =====

Here all players make overlapping runs. The ST becomes playmaker and has no back pass options. A counter attack can't be prevented.

===== Ignoring the pivot =====

In this situation the RCM has no vertical passing options after his dribbling. A back pass to the CDM is the only resonable option, as the CDM has the time to reassess the situation.

Also, the right winger should have stayed in E and the LCM is overlapping instead of providing a passing option. Here, he //must// stand still in B4 and wait for an easy pass.

In the end, the RCM gets isolated by himself but also by his teammates decisions.

By the way: The LW should have stayed in A but is controlled by AI.

===== Build-up =====

We constantly observe that our possession distribution isn't optimal, yet. Sometimes we get the following distribution out of 75-80% possession: 1. 3rd: 30%; 2. 3rd: 40%; 3. 3rd: 5-10%. A striven distribution should look like this 10%-40%-25%.

In this situation both CMs withdraw and provide short passing options. That results in 8 players in the 1. and 2. line (GK, back of 4, CDM, 2 CMs). The opponent is pressing franticly in C2-D4 with 6 players. 
There are 5 vertical lanes (A-E) in Positional Play. Ideally each lane is occupied by one player between opponents defensive line and midfield. (LW: A3-4; LCM: B3; ST: C3-4; RCM: D3; RW: E3-4). We have to trust the CDM, GK and 2 CBs to resist opponents pressing and verticalize into proper zones. Therefore they need options in 3rd and 4th line. Thus, LCM could occupy B3 to overcome their pressing.
