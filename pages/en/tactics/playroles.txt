[size=3]//-> Main article: [[en:tactics:halfdefender|Halfdefender]]//[/size]

{{ :playground:hiv.jpg?200|}}**Red:** The area the LCB/RCB are usually to be found. ({{:playground:screen-shot-2015-05-06-at-22.32.51.png?linkonly|"defensive interior corridor"}})

**Orange:** The area the LCB/RCB switches to, in order to make the game {{:playground:dffgdfg.jpg?linkonly|wide in the buildup phase}}, if the opponent is pressing high up the pitch. The zones on the first line can be used at {{:playground:2q_.jpg?linkonly|goal kicks}}

**Yellow:** Special area for the {{:playground:343hiv.jpg?linkonly|3-4-3-diamond}} and further retreating point to evade the opponents midfield pressing.

**Lightblue:** LCB/RCB are only allowed to stay in the penalty box at opponents set pieces, high pressure and significantly possession of the opponent (with good implementation of Positional Play this isn't often the case)

{{ :playground:lib.jpg?200|}}**Red:** The main area in positional play of the CDM, also called the space of the six. In this space the CDM serves as hedging player and free man in the center for LCM/RCM and LCB/RCB respectively.

**Lighyellow:** If the ball remains a long time on the wing, the CDM may move into the half-space, in order to overload that zone and prepare a switch of play.

**Yellow:** Ist LIV oder RIV im Ball stark unter Druck lÃ¤sst sich der ZDM auch mal in den eigenen Sechzehner fallen, um eine Ablage zu fordern.
If LCB/RCB in possession is pressed, the CDM can drops into the box to support the build-up.

===== Wide making winger =====

The wide making winger sticks to the touchline, plays linearly and
runs back and forth and back and forth and back and forth.
