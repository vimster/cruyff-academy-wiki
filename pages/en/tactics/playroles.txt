{{ :playground:zm.jpg?200|}}**Red:** The area the playmaker is mainly present,
in order to build triangles with the wingers and send offensive signals to the

**Yellow:** In that zone the playmaker is supposed to stay if the center
sweeper is not available for a pass or building triangles is required in the center.

**Orange:** The so-called space of the 10 where either of the two playmakers
is to stay, in order to overload the center and generate triangles on the
far side and in the center, respectively.

**Lightyellow:** This area is supposed to be penetrated by the playmaker for a
finishing action if there is no real center striker.
