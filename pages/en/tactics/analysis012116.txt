====== Contemporary Analysis #2 ======

===== Pointless Passes =====

  *Passing without purpose
  *Passing just for the sake of possession and passing rates
  *No moving forward
  *No chance of creating danger

===== How it should be instead =====

  *Defenders + CDM carry the ball forward
  *Everyone else moves up
  *What is "Passing with purpose"?
  *Control the ball/keep possession in "High-Priority-Area" and don't stick around in our own half
  *every pass in our own half is one pass too much
  *stop playing direct/one-touch passes without reason/pressure

===== Slow Reactions =====

  *We play quick and pointless passes without pressure, but when we get under pressure and actually need quick passes, we don't do it and dribble into defenders instead, why?
  *When the ball moves towards you, you should already know what you are going to do that does not make you lose the ball
  *One reason why we can't create danger is that our players turn into defenders right when they receive a pass, stop it!!
  *If you can't keep the ball under pressure or you don't know what to do in tight situations, you are just not good enough and need to practice [[en:guides:training|OFFLINE on legendary]]
