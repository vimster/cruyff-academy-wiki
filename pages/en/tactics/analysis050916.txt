====== Contemporary Analysis #4 ======

May 9th 2016

===== Regained Strength? =====

After a short time of crisis, a few players left and we changed the formation. The ST was replaced, the number of trialists reduced. The formation was changed first from 4-3-3 to 3-4-3 and now to [[http://cruyff-academy.crayos.de/doku.php?id=en:tactics:systemscompact#ultra-offensive_nerd-edition|2-1-4-3]].

Let's see what went wrong first and then find the reason why we won 10 games in a row right after we changed it.

===== Problems from last month =====

If you remember the [[en:tactics:analysis042716|previous analysis]] we had many problems defending counter attacks and we had a "false" ST that tracked back to get the ball in low areas. We also had many trialists on RW/LW who very rarely played how we need them to play.

This was our formation ingame if you remember. We then discussed how we could prevent counter attacks through C2-4 by placing a CB there. Unfortunately, a 3-4-3 would be out of question, but we still tried it - and failed miserably.

The ST tracked back to contribute to build-up and combinations, ofcourse, which corrupted our game completely. The CAM had to leave his position constantly to compensate the "false" ST. There was no control possible and we scored very rarely and randomly if we did. 

In comparison, here is what a 3-4-3 (diamond) would actually look like:

{{ :en:tactics:343right.png?250 |}}

CDM, LCM, RCM, CAM keep the diamond alive. The ST stays on a line with the opponent's defense and looks for gaps to run into. The combination play in the diamond helps to control the ball up front and to create chances for LW/ST/RW in the end. 

===== From "false" 9 to "real " 9 =====

As you should probably know by now, our ST was a big problem. He didn't run into spaces and preferred to move back to get the ball. As soon as he got it, he started dribblings everytime to get to the goal. This worked approximately 1-2 times a match and ended in a goal, but we lost the ball every other time.

We rarely played combinations or controlled the ball in the [[http://cruyff-academy.crayos.de/doku.php?id=en:tactics:compact#high_priority_area|high priority area]] because of the ST playing selfishly and/or ignoring the structure and his teammates. 

In 22 matches he scored 24 goals and had 1 assist. 

Now let's compare that to our new ST.

Our new "real" ST constantly tries to find gaps to run into and also makes "dummy runs" to drag away defenders and create gaps for other players to run into. He also knows when to assist and when to shoot in almost all situations and rarely loses the ball. A real teamplayer.

In 22 matches he scored 24 goals and had 11 assists. See the difference?

And not just that: His positioning makes it possible for the midfielders to switch positions more fluidly, create overloads and make combinations. It is also much easier for them to assist the ST, because he now doesn't move back anymore to get the ball into his feet and dribble towards the goal himself. It is also possible for the CM's to get into the box to get assists from the ST because of his teamplay.

Many more possibilities by switching just one position.

===== New Formation =====

In this 2-1-4-3 every player is connected to at least 2 teammates so triangles are automatically there for combination play. I also added a "heatmap" to show the major movements in this system and where the ball gets passed to most of the time. 

Combinations are possible in the center and on the wings. LAM and RAM stay high and are available for combinations, LM and RM stay wide for switches of play. LAM/RAM/LM/RM can be controlled by AI and they still do their job very well and better than most human players. LCM or RCM can overload the other halfspace by moving to C so we can either create chances there or finish on the other side. 

This would not be possible if the ST ran back like our previous ST did.

In comparison, here is our old formation and "heatmap":

{{ :en:tactics:433heatmap.png?250 |}}

LB and RB had almost no purpose in our game. 

Passes behind defense were very rarely possible, because RW/LW didn't move intelligently behind defense. The ST didn't run into gaps and only waited to get the ball into his feet to make dribblings instead of getting assists. 

LW/RW had, when controlled by AI and by most human players, almost no purpose in our game other than staying wide to create space for the center. If they didn't use runs effectively, they were almost completely useless.

Now, each position has its purpose and has an important part in combinations and build-up. Let's see if and how long it will stay this way and what is going to happen in the future.
