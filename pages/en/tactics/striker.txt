====== Striker ======

{{ :playground:st.jpg?200|}}**Red:** The center striker stays permanently
along the offside line and waits for through balls by the playmakers into the
box.

**Lightyellow**: In possesson in deeper zones the striker needs to stay in the
frontline for the purpose of creating room for the wingers and midfielders.

===== Preface =====

Inzaghi was mediocre on the ball and wasn't great at passing. However, he always knew when and where to move to score goals.

The quantity of passes and ball contacts should be irrelevant for a "real" striker. Instead, goals are crucial and the knowledge of how to achieve them.

===== 9 commandments of the #9 =====

<code>
1. In the last third: prefer running for through balls instead of standing around for X-passes
2. Always try to stay along the defensive line, close to offside, to be ready for through balls
3. Wait for and identify the "signals" from your teammates
4. Drag defenders with you by dummy running
5. Stay in the middle!
6. Scoring is your priority - do not always try to pass if it isn't obvious
7. FIFA 15: the near post is your best friend!
8. FIFA 15: in a 1on1 against the goalie you can always try to run past him
9. Teammate with ball on the wing: move away from him and close to goal for crosses

===== Making room for teammates =====

It is very important for you to lure away defenders by moving into spaces and/or away from your teammates on the ball. This procedure is called "Dummy Running" because you do not always get the pass from your teammate but you still drag a defender with you which creates spaces for your mates to either run oder dribble into.

Most strikers tend to move closer to their teammates on the ball to "support" them and ask for a short pass. However: you certainly do not support them - you actually take space away from them and take away the opportunity to make a possibly dangerous through ball in your direction because you...

  -...move closer to them and not into space, so there is no possibility to move closer to the goal
  -...drag a defender with you by moving closer to them which is taking away even more space for them to be creative

The so called "False Nine" would be the only type of player to move closer and take part in combinational play rather than the "real" striker - which you must be.

Never forget: Talented players can only unfold their talent fully if you move away from them to give them space to be creative.

As soon as Quaresma (7) cuts inside on the right, his teammates in the box move //away// from him, so that the opponent's defenders have to follow and cover them. 

Expecially look at Jackson Mart√≠nez (9), who actively moves towards the goalkeeper: He certainly doesn't expect a pass to him - he only wants to drag a defender with him (Dummy Running).

All that makes it possible for Quaresma to make a little fake shot to get in a nice shooting position.

An incredibly common mistake would have been that Quaresma's mates move closer to him to "help". However, if they moved closer, not only them would have moved closer: defenders would have followed them taking away even more space for Ricardo.

Please do not ever forget this simple but underestimated rule:

  You help a creative player much more by moving away 
  instead of moving towards him. 
  Because by moving towards a creative player doesn't 
  only mean that just you moves closer to him 
  but at least one defender is going to follow you.

While the ball is moving more and more to the right, Lewandowski moves more and more to the left to draw defenders and create huge space on the right.

A common FIFA-player would have tried to //support// Robben here by moving more and more to the //right//, as soon as he moves there. By doing that, the right side would have been full of players and the little one two with Mitchell Weiser would have never been possible.

I could show even more examples to show how important it is to move away from your teammates but I hope you got the message.

If you ever encounter a specimen crying to you that you "always run away" and they "cannot do anything because of you", then this specimen should play on a position that requires no creativity. You're the striker and you're moving away, preferably closer to the goal? You're doing the right thing.

===== Lying in wait for through balls =====

Let me emphasise it again and again: move away from your teammates on the ball, move inside the opponent's defending line as if you were one of them to always be ready for a through ball.

===== Communication through signals =====

You're in permanent communication with your teammates. Not certainly because you //talk// to them, but because there are certain signals that you have to follow to avoid misunderstandings:

  If a teammate doesn't pass the ball immediately 
  but dribbles a little (espacially if he cuts inside)
  it means that he waits for YOU to run for a through ball.
  If the pass works you have a good chance to score.
  If the pass doesn't work you gave your teammate more space
  to dribble by moving away from him.

The same goes to other positions: while the striker should move //away// most of the time, there are also signals for short passes. If you move closer to your teammate whilst holding L2, you signalise him that you want to have a short pass with X. But if you move away you signalise that you do //not// want him to pass with X.

**Each player in the team has to be vary of these signals. Without them there will be too many misunderstandings and lot's of problems with creating scoring chances especially against good teams.**

===== Misinterpretation =====

There are many strikers, who want to get through balls but it's impossible to get it to them. Reasons can be:

  *Horizontal/diagonal runs -> through balls get on your heels or behind your back, not into your run
  *running too early before a controlled through ball is possible -> offside or taking away only X-pass-option
  *running towards the wing to get the ball -> ST is missing in the center and you take away space from the wingers!

It is mostly impossible to use through balls when someone is running diagonally or horizontally towards the goal. Instead, focus on running vertically and time your runs exactly right, so you don't get into offside too often. Try to start running from a deeper position for example, so it's obvious for your teammates that you are ready for a through ball and they have time to prepare the pass.

Very important: Only start running for a through ball, when the teammate on the ball is facing your direction. Don't start running while the ball is rolling from A to B or while your teammate is facing the opposite direction. If you do that, you will be in offside once the through ball is actually ready.

Very important, too: Please please please stay in the center and don't run towards the wings. The only thing you can do there, is pass back or lose the ball in a dribbling. The wings are for the wingers and full-backs and you would only take away their space. It is very important to understand this! If you do this, it is a sign that you only care about getting the ball and not about your teammates.

Extremely important, especially for you: DO NOT TURN INTO THE OPPONENT! Always check, before receiving the ball: Where is space to turn into? Where is a teammate to pass to? If you start checking these things AFTER receiving the ball, it is almost always too late and you lose the ball, and, more importantly (even if they don't say it out of sympathy): You lose your teammate's trust.
