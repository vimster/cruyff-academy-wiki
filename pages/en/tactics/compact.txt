====== Our Philosophy - Compact ======

===== Summary =====

The philosophy can be summarized as follows:

  *Technique: Know all important aspects of the game.
  *Decision Making: Make the right decisions in every situation.
  *Control: Keep control in every situation.
  *Pressure: On the opponent both when defending and when attacking.
  *Simplicity: Make it look simple and beautiful.
  *Evolution: Never stop learning.

The overall goal is to constantly put pressure on the opponent on and off the ball whilst keeping control at the same time.

To do that, we need to obtain the necessary technique. 

After that, we have to learn by experience and certain rules what decisions to make ingame. 

When we obtained a decent decision making, we can control the game. 

To start winning regularly, we have to put constant pressure on the opponent. 

When we can do all that, our game looks simple automatically. 

To stay on a certain level or get better, we shall never stop learning.

Skip one of these points and the philosophy changes completely.

===== The Art of Domination =====

  "Dominating means creating more scoring chances than your opponent. 
  I connect the term "dominance" with attacking football and pressing in the opponent's half."
  - Louis van Gaal

We want to dominate our opponent at any time. When we do, we are always close to scoring. When we don't, we are always close to conceding.

Alot of people think that having more possession is enough. "We had more possession, we deserved to win!" That is just not true. To fully dominate your opponent you need to perfect 4 points:

  *at least 65% possession
  *pressure on the opponent on and off the ball
  *scoring chances
  *prevent the opponent's scoring chances

To dominate the opponent we need to accomplish these 4 points as a team. To do that, we have to stick to specific rules and player roles. Certain roles are tied to every position. This leads us to the next point.

===== Positional Play =====

{{ :en:tactics:zones.png?300 |}}

From now on, when we talk about specific positions (or "zones" -> "Zonal Play") we will always talk about "lines" (like "line 1-3" or just "A" or "C") and exact terms for each position (like "B4" or "D2") for simplification.

Now let's talk about "phases" and "areas".

==== Finishing Phase ====

  *Lines 5 and 6
  *"freedom zone"
  *rules not as strict as in the other lines
  *the box is always limited to 3 players only
  *optimal positioning in the box: LW in B6, ST in C6 and RW in D6

==== High Priority Area ====

  *Zones B4-5, C4-5 and D4-5 combined
  *preferred zone for chance creation
  *overloading of one side
  *also think defensively and think about what happens when you lose the ball
  *no premature switch of play, stay on overloaded side as long as possible until we control the game in this area

==== Build-up Phase ====

  *Lines 1-4
