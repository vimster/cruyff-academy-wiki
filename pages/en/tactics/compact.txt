====== Our Philosophy - Compact ======

===== Summary =====

The philosophy can be summarized as follows:

  *Technique: Know all important aspects of the game.
  *Decision Making: Make the right decisions in every situation.
  *Control: Keep control in every situation.
  *Pressure: On the opponent both when defending and when attacking.
  *Simplicity: Make it look simple and beautiful.
  *Evolution: Never stop learning.

The overall goal is to constantly put pressure on the opponent on and off the ball whilst keeping control at the same time.

To do that, we need to obtain the necessary technique. 

After that, we have to learn by experience and certain rules what decisions to make ingame. 

When we obtained a decent decision making, we can control the game. 

To start winning regularly, we have to put constant pressure on the opponent. 

When we can do all that, our game looks simple automatically. 

To stay on a certain level or get better, we shall never stop learning.

Skip one of these points and the philosophy changes completely.
