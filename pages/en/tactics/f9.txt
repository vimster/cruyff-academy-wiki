====== False 9 ======

===== The Idea =====
{{ :en:tactics:f91.jpg?200|}}

A very controversial topic in my opinion. There are very rare cases, where a so-called "False 9" makes sense and actually works. There are also problems with how people view this "position". 

The term "false" only tells us that it is not a "real 9", but what else is it then? There are a few ways and a few players in history who were very good "False 9s", like Totti, Di Stefano or Puskas. But the most recent and most famous player that made the media create the term "False 9" is Messi, of course.

In this case, the more accurate term for Messi's style would be "Fluid 9".

Guardiola had this idea on May 2nd 2009. Barcelona played against Madrid in Bernabéu. As most of you probably know, Eto'o was still there and played striker for them while Messi was on the right wing.

After ten minutes in the game against Real Madrid, Guardiola told Eto'o and Messi to switch positions. Leo shouldn't play completely forward, though. Instead, he should play just like another midfielder.

Guardiola told Xavi and Iniesta: "If you see Leo between the lines in the middle, do not wonder. Just give the ball to him."

And to Messi himself: "Leo, when Xavi and Andrés leave the line and pass the ball to you, you move directly towards the goal."

Barcelona won 6:2 against Real Madrid in this match.

===== How to do it? =====

To summarize Messi's play in few and simple words is probably impossible. However, I will try to provide a simplified version of the Fluid/False 9.

  *Do not (or very rarely) run behind the defensive line for through balls
  *Instead, position yourself between the opponent's midfield and defense for direct passes into your feet (while holding L2!)
  *Try to overload one of the halfspaces

==== Possibilities ====

The possible plays when getting the ball in this situation depend very much on the player's abilities. A strategic mind can also be of importance, if you want the False 9 to orchestrate the attack like Messi does/did. By "strategic" I mean the following:

  *Know how to position yourself before receiving the ball, in order to have maximum possibilities with the ball
  *Know how to move after passing the ball
  *Know when to dribble, when to play one-twos and when to assist or finish yourself

It is usual to pick one halfspace over the other to start plays. With a left foot, it is more dangerous to move diagonally from the right halfspace towards the goal, for example. A right-footed player would move inside from the left halfspace.

Ofcourse, pictures and videos are better to explain things, so here we go:

Just like described before, Messi starts from the right halfspace and moves diagonally inside towards the goal, here by playing quick one-touch passes.

This diagonal movement towards the goal will be present in all of the next videos.

Basically the same thing, but prooving that it also works under more pressure. With the described movement and passing, Messi gets behind defender after defender. It's like they don't exist.

Now a different situation: The False 9 doesn't play a major strategic role in this attack but is instead waiting behind the right winger in D5, just like I said before: between the opponent's defense and midfield.

The thing I want to point out is, that Messi doesn't stop after playing a pass. Just how I described before, he keeps moving towards the goal. He even would have been ready for a lateral one-two with Iniesta.

Simple explanation: Start from a deep position, preferably right-halfspace (between opponent's defense & midfield), move diagonally towards goal by dribblings/one-twos and finish. Messi in a nutshell.

Also, take a look at the opponent's last defenders: They are completely irrelevant. They just stand there, and cannot do anything to prevent the attacks. They cannot get involved because there are no strikers. And just when the ball got in their direction, it's already in the goal.

Metzelder, who played against Barcelona with Real Madrid, described it the following:

  "Fabio (Cannavaro) and I asked ourselves: What shall we do? Do we follow him or stay behind? 
  We didn't know what to do and we just couldn't stop him."
  
==== Discussion about False 9 ====

=== What's the difference between a hanging striker and a False 9? ===

Nominally, the F9 is the ST. The difference can be seen in the movement: The F9 is basically always in a vertical and/or diagonal line with the other players, like Messi does. He sometimes waits in attack without doing anything, then moves back to help in build up and contribute in combinations or moves to the right wing to create connections there.

That means he has a vague connection to the ST position, in which he plays on the sheet, the hanging ST does not. He usually is playing horizontally, around another ST (playing with LS + RS for example), like with Müller when Van Gaal was at Bayern. Müller' position back then could be called a "Schattenstürmer" = "Shadow Striker".

=== When do you play with a F9? ===

If you play with much possession, want the wingers to have more possibilities to score goals and want another creative man in midfield. If the F9 isn't creative, then it doesn't make sense playing with it. One big advantage is, that you don't have a classic ST, which you have to ignore in build up and combinations, since he usually is limited on the ball and constantly makes runs. 

With a F9 you have much more connections and possibilities to play through the center. Especially since it is the position in front of the opponent's defensive line, in which the most dangerous chances can be created. This space gets ignored with a real ST, you are not able to use this important space and you weaken yourself in the center.

A F9 increases fluidity and flexibility in midfield a lot. With another player in midfield, the wingers and fullbacks can stay higher and wider without weakening build up play. 

This is very important to understand Positional Play and Barcelona under Guardiola. One example was the match Barcelona vs Real Madrid that ended 6:2 for Barca. Before Messi, Eto'o was the ST and Xavi and Iniesta had to play extremely cautious and accurate. When Messi was told to go to the middle and got used to his new role, Xavi and Iniesta could move more and had an extra player in midfield who they could pass to, who didn't lose the ball and could pass back immediately to them. 

Before that, Xavi had more missed passes than in other matches. With Messi, they could even move further up: Iniesta usually up in the left halfspace and Xavi made some vertical runs. All while Messi was both covering behind them, available for passes and combinations. 

Also an important aspect to understand Barcelona is that especially Iniesta and Messi are two players who can keep the ball in attack in the important halfspaces between the lines, while others can make runs into spaces.

Bayern under Heynckes could do that in build up with Schweinsteiger, who moved to the wing when he had someone covering behind him. But Bayern couldn't do that in a higher position, because they didn't have a dropping ST. 

They especially had problems when they played with Schweinsteiger + Kroos CM, Müller CAM and Gomez ST. Müller and Gomez didn't drop and created no fluidity in midfield. So Kroos and Schweinsteiger were "stuck" on their positions and created no movement. 

If there was a central attacker, that dropped deeper, the CM's would be able to make movements and you would have more possibilities in midfield. If they can't, the playstyle is predictable, static and has no flow. A F9 assures this important fluidity, especially in build up.

=== Who should play with a False 9? ===

Possession is very important for the F9. If you play counter attacks you have the ball for a very short time. The Striker can hardly fall back in build-up and immediately be at the front again, since you only play forward quickly in counter attacks. 

However, if you are in possession, the F9 has more time to look for spaces rather than find the right spot quickly, react quickly and then run forward quickly, which is basically impossible. 

In counter attack football, when you get the ball in defense, you look for the quickest way forward. This doesn't work with a F9, because if it drops back, it gets ignored anyway because the pass comes forward, mostly to the winger. The winger then has no option in the middle, because the F9 is too deep.

A counter attack is an attack into one direction: You only play forward. If you have an attacker who is moving in the opposite direction, you can guess that it doesn't make sense and is counter productive (pun intended).

If you play with much possession, the opponent is defending in a solid formation and is not moving very much. So if a F9 moves backwards and another player moves forward, you are in an advantage: You are moving and your opponent is not. So you are controlling both space and ball because you have enough players in the middle to play with and you also have players who can create space by running forward, without having the risk of losing the ball. 

With a F9 you can create movements in an otherwise stiff formation without a F9.

You could also see the that Barcelona tried to avoid playing counter attacks, before Tito Vilanova became coach. Same with the Spanish national team: One aspect of the 1:1 match Spain vs Italy in Euro 2012, where Italy opened up spaces for possible counter attacks on purpose, because they knew Spain doesn't exploit them. 

Spain could have countered there, but they didn't have the players to play counter attacks. That's how they made it easier for Italy to attack them.
