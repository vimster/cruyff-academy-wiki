====== Quotations ======

In this article we collect important sayings of Positional Play coaches.

===== Juanma Lillo =====

... on the subject of long balls and counter-attacks in football:
> "The faster the ball goes, the faster it comes back"

> "If you develop your play slowly you'll be under pressure from the start, for sure. But if your football's very fast and direct you're going to have the ball thrown back at you almost immediately. In football, to get up high, you need passing movements in the main part of the pitch. There's only one thing that gives or takes away order in a game and that's the ball itself, so I like my players to be in lots of different partnerships but als strung across different areas of the field. If their passing is good, then we'll be moving our rivals all over the pitch and then you're going to find free men easily because they'll either be forced to break up playing partnerships or string themselves out across the pitch. If players don't take the time to construct play it will be difficult to get the ball to the right places up the pitch and then dominate the opposition. If you play the ball upfield at top speed all the time, hitting first time long balls, the ball will be back on top of you in seconds. Up and down, up and down ... You have to pass when the moment's right, to the right player. Get that wrong and you'll be playing long balls for your opponents to gobble up and then come at you in numbers"

> "If the basic idea is to set up camp in the oppositions's half then the fundamental thing is to play the ball out from the back in a manner which takes advantage of, and is inherently linked to, the talents and culture of your team. Only if you achieve this clinically and intelligently can you drop anchor in the opponents' half."

... on attacking and defending as a unit:
> "Travel together but not just on the same train - in the same carriage"


... on the right distribution of the players on the pitch:
> "in recovery phase, always a step forward (defensive work by reducing space) and in possession phase, always a step backwards (offensive work by making the pitch bigger)"
===== Pep Guardiola =====

... on dominating and controlling from the start:
> "I've already mentioned this idea of taking the initiative as a vital part of any successful attack. If were the ones initiating the action, as opposed to simply reacting, then we'll be able to control the flow of the game. The opponents then have to react to what we do, which automatically means a limited choice of options. It makes them more predictable. Then we are in the driving seat and can anticipate what's going to happen next and can go on controlling the action."


===== Domenec Torrent =====

... on Positional Play, teached by Pep at Bayern:
> “Yes, he had to cover that too because they'd never played like that before and had no real understanding of what it meant. For Pep and Barca it became a habit but in Munich they still believed that it was a style of play used to maintain high possession. Rubbish! It's a game of position, not possession! It's about how you place yourself in relation to the others on the field when you have the ball and where you should be so that you can continue pressing when you lose it. ... Positional Play definitely symbolises all that Guardiola achieved at Bayern. ... Many people argue that a more direct style is always more effective but both Barca and Bayern have proved that Positional Play can be just as successful. The German players were actually quite surprised by the intensity of this kind of work, how much physical effort is required. They also came to see that Positional Play is more or less the essence of fottball; you lose the ball, you press,you get it back, you begin to open up the play again and you're in control again. ”

===== Andrés Iniesta =====

> “We passed from one era to the next and suddenly there was a different way of playing and a different way of understanding what we were trying to do and how we would go about trying to hurt the opposition. There was coming out with the ball using the centre backs or with the full backs, then there was the tactic of dropping the holding midfielder between the central defenders. I had never experienced such a definitive style of play. We always played a midfield three with one holding player flanked by two more attacking players. I was one of the attacking midfielders and I used to have to come back to receive the ball. But Pep changed that; he told me to be much higher up the pitch to be ready for the next phase of play.”

===== Xavi Hernández =====

> "98% of the people love Football, but only 2% understand it."
===== Ortleface =====
> "Cruyff Academy changed my life"
