====== Quotations ======

In this article we collect important sayings of Positional Play coaches.

===== Juanma Lillo =====

... on the subject of long balls and counter-attacks in football:
> "The faster the ball goes, the faster it comes back"

> "If you develop your play slowly you'll be under pressure from the start, for sure. But if your football's very fast and direct you're going to have the ball thrown back at you almost immediately. In football, to get up high, you need passing movements in the main part of the pitch. There's only one thing that gives or takes away order in a game and that's the ball itself, so I like my players to be in lots of different partnerships but als strung across different areas of the field. If their passing is good, then we'll be moving our rivals all over the pitch and then you're going to find free men easily because they'll either be forced to break up playing partnerships or string themselves out across the pitch. If players don't take the time to construct play it will be difficult to get the ball to the right places up the pitch and then dominate the opposition. If you play the ball upfield at top speed all the time, hitting first time long balls, the ball will be back on top of you in seconds. Up and down, up and down ... You have to pass when the moment's right, to the right player. Get that wrong and you'll be playing long balls for your opponents to gobble up and then come at you in numbers"
