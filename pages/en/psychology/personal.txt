====== Developing a Growth Mindset ======
|**Instead of saying...**|**...say this:**|
|I'm not good at this|What am I missing?|
|I give up|I'll use a different strategy|
|It's good enough|Is this really my best work?|
|I can't make this any better|I can always improve|
|This is too hard|This may take some time|
|I made a mistake|Mistakes help me to learn|
|I just can't do this|I am going to train my brain|
|I'll never be that smart|I will learn how to do this|
|Plan A didn't work|There's always Plan B|
|My friend can do it|I will learn from them|
