===== Psychological aspects =====

Implementing positional play in FIFA may be very nerve-racking. Everyone is required to be patient, willing to learn and self-critical to have success in the first place.

Before a rookie begins to play positional play, he needs to forget everything he has heard so far about football through the media landscape, friends and "experts" providing a mainly simplistic view.
The large mass of football fans are merely scratching the surface.

You should rather spend time on relevant aspects of football, and not on issues like what a portuguese trainer has to say about a competitors wife (([[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/11769730/Chelsea-news-Jose-Mourinho-hits-back-at-Rafa-Benitezs-wife-with-fat-jibe.html]])).
