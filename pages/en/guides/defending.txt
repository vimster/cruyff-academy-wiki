Keep distance to the opposing player and follow his movements by **holding L2** (L2 and R2 for faster jockeying). Once the opponent is near you a manual tackle or sliding tackle can be conducted. Oftentimes, it is sufficient to **stay on L2** and wait until the opponent is running into your player, though.

The most crucial thing is to stay **closer to the own goal** than the opponent. As soon as this isn't the case and the opponent is running with full speed you have no chance to intervene anymore. Hence, do not go to the ball aggressively (especially as last man) and keep the distance with L2 in order to cover the room in front of the opponent.

A lot of defenders hold L2 and additionally move back and forth or spin in front of the opponent, in order to cover more space.

Important: When you attack the player in possession, you are giving him the opportunity to take you out of the game by dribbling or passing. If you keep distance it is most likely that the opponent is overstrained and runs into your player.

**Prefer L2 (jockeying) over X (containing)** to block shots inside the own box! It prevents you from causing penalties. 

If you are overrun by an opponent, try to slow down the opponent by pressing (cirlce).
