====== Passing ======
===== Short passes =====

==== As pass receiver ====

  *hold L2 permanently
  *opposing defenders must be behind you or far away from you
  *try to build a triangle with the passer and an additional player

By holding the L2 button you ensure that your player permanently keeps the viewing direction onto the ball and at the same time to the passer. Hence, you attain four things:

  - pass is not played in the back
  - pass is not played in the run
  - ball does not bounce in 99 percent of cases ((1% random errors, which are beyond our influence))
  - you signal the player in possession, that you demand a x-pass

That is a crucial mistake of the vast majority of the FIFA community: It is **not** enough to run alongside the player in possession using the left stick - you move partially with the back to that player which results in a lower pass success rate.
When you want to receive a short x-pass and don't hold L2, you reduce the likelihood of an accurate pass.

Instead, it is more likely that one of the following four things happens:

  * pass is played 2-3 meters in the back
  * pass is played 2-3 meters into the run
  * ball rebounds from the the heel of the pass receiver
  * pass receiver did not expect the pass
==== As passer ====

As passer it is your task to pay attention to the movements of your teammates and check wheather they comply with the conditions for a x-pass (as stated above).

Only, if the pass receiver sticks to the rules, you are allowed to play a x-pass, in order to make sure that the pass is carried out successfully.

If there are multiple players available for a pass, you have to decide, which one will have the most options after receiving the ball.  //Is he able to initiate an attack? Does he have different passing options? Does he stand closer to the goal? //

===== Through passes =====
==== As pass receiver ====

  *do not hold L2
  *only decide for runs into free spaces
  *depending on the situation either you have to sprint (long way and plenty of space)
  *...or run moderately (short way and little room)
  *never interrupt your run or change the direction

If you hold L2 or stand still, the through pass will not reach you. A through ball to a standing teammate will either be played unreachable into the empty space or directly into the foot, which is the same as a x-pass.

Always make sure that the direction you are running to is not occupied by an opposing player. The pass will very likely be intercepted.

If you are close to the passer reduce your speed, especially when your are near the offside line. If the distance is longer you should run with full speed.

**In a nutshell:** //The closer you get to the pass receiver, the slower you have to run.//

The accuracy of through balls depends on many factors (orientation of the player, left/right foot, ..).  Sometimes you can conduct a perfect run, but the ball ends in the hands of the goalkeeper.

==== As Passer ====

As stated above in the short pass section, as passer you have to make sure, that your teammates stick to the rules and requirements of a successfull pass. In addition you need to choose a proper pass dosage.

===== Presence and involvement =====

There are a lot of players who complain about insufficient involvement and criticise, that from their point of view they don't get enough passes.
Oftentimes there are discrepancies of ball contacts between the LCM and RCM. There are several reasons for this.

  * The far side of the camera gets neglected subconsciously. For example playing from left to right the game becomes automatically right-weighted.
  * One side is occupied by more virtual pros than the other.
