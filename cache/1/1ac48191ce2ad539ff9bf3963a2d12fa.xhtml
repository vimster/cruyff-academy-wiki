<p>
Here all players make overlapping runs. The ST becomes playmaker and has no back pass options. A counter attack can&#039;t be prevented.

<p>
In this situation the RCM has no vertical passing options after his dribbling. A back pass to the CDM is the only resonable option, as the CDM has the time to reassess the situation.
</p>

<p>
Also, the right winger should have stayed in E and the LCM is overlapping instead of providing a passing option. Here, he <em>must</em> stand still in B4 and wait for an easy pass.
</p>

<p>
In the end, the RCM gets isolated by himself but also by his teammates decisions.
</p>

<p>
By the way: The LW should have stayed in A but is controlled by AI.
