<p>
Here all players make overlapping runs. The ST becomes playmaker and has no back pass options. A counter attack can&#039;t be prevented.

<p>
In this situation the RCM has no vertical passing options after his dribbling. A back pass to the CDM is the only resonable option, as the CDM has the time to reassess the situation.
</p>

<p>
Also, the right winger should have stayed in E and the LCM is overlapping instead of providing a passing option. Here, he <em>must</em> stand still in B4 and wait for an easy pass.
</p>

<p>
In the end, the RCM gets isolated by himself but also by his teammates decisions.
</p>

<p>
By the way: The LW should have stayed in A but is controlled by AI.

<p>
We constantly observe that our possession distribution isn&#039;t optimal, yet. Sometimes we get the following distribution out of 75-80% possession: 1. 3rd: 30%; 2. 3rd: 40%; 3. 3rd: 5-10%. A striven distribution should look like this 10%-40%-25%.
</p>

<p>
In this situation both CMs withdraw and provide short passing options. That results in 8 players in the 1. and 2. line (GK, back of 4, CDM, 2 CMs). The opponent is pressing franticly in C2-D4 with 6 players. 
There are 5 vertical lanes (A-E) in Positional Play. Ideally each lane is occupied by one player between opponents defensive line and midfield. (LW: A3-4; LCM: B3; ST: C3-4; RCM: D3; RW: E3-4). We have to trust the CDM, GK and 2 CBs to resist opponents pressing and verticalize into proper zones. Therefore they need options in 3rd and 4th line. Thus, LCM could occupy B3 to overcome their pressing.
