<h2 class="sectionedit2" id="summary">Summary</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
The philosophy can be summarized as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li">Technique: Know all important aspects of the game.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li">Decision Making: Make the right decisions in every situation.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li">Control: Keep control in every situation.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li">Pressure: On the opponent both when defending and when attacking.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li">Simplicity: Make it look simple and beautiful.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li">Evolution: Never stop learning.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The overall goal is to constantly put pressure on the opponent on and off the ball whilst keeping control at the same time.
</p>

<p>
To do that, we need to obtain the necessary technique. 
</p>

<p>
After that, we have to learn by experience and certain rules what decisions to make ingame. 
</p>

<p>
When we obtained a decent decision making, we can control the game. 
</p>

<p>
To start winning regularly, we have to put constant pressure on the opponent. 
</p>

<p>
When we can do all that, our game looks simple automatically. 
</p>

<p>
To stay on a certain level or get better, we shall never stop learning.
</p>

<p>
Skip one of these points and the philosophy changes completely.

<h2 class="sectionedit5" id="the_art_of_domination">The Art of Domination</h2>
<div class="level2">
<pre class="code">&quot;Dominating means creating more scoring chances than your opponent. 
I connect the term &quot;dominance&quot; with attacking football and pressing in the opponent&#039;s half.&quot;
- Louis van Gaal</pre>

<p>
We want to dominate our opponent at any time. When we do, we are always close to scoring. When we don&#039;t, we are always close to conceding.
</p>

<p>
Alot of people think that having more possession is enough. “We had more possession, we deserved to win!” That is just not true. To fully dominate your opponent you need to perfect 4 points:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li">at least 65% possession</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li">pressure on the opponent on and off the ball</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li">scoring chances</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li">prevent the opponent&#039;s scoring chances</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
To dominate the opponent we need to accomplish these 4 points as a team. To do that, we have to stick to specific rules and player roles. Certain roles are tied to every position. This leads us to the next point.

<p>
From now on, when we talk about specific positions (or “zones” → “Zonal Play”) we will always talk about “lines” (like “line 1-3” or just “A” or “C”) and exact terms for each position (like “B4” or “D2”) for simplification.
</p>

<p>
Now let&#039;s talk about “phases” and “areas”.
