</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li">try to build a triangle with the passer and an additional player</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
By holding the L2 button you ensure that your player permanently keeps the viewing direction onto the ball and at the same time to the passer. Hence, you attain four things:
</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> pass is not played in the back</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> pass is not played in the run</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> ball does not bounce in 99 percent of cases <sup><a href="#fn__1" id="fnt__1" class="fn_top">1)</a></sup></div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> you signal the player in possession, that you demand a x-pass</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
That is a crucial mistake of the vast majority of the FIFA community: It is <strong>not</strong> enough to run alongside the player in possession using the left stick - you move partially with the back to that player which results in a lower pass success rate.
When you want to receive a short x-pass and don&#039;t hold L2, you reduce the likelihood of an accurate pass.
</p>

<p>
Instead, it is more likely that one of the following four things is happening:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> pass is played 2-3 meters in the back</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> pass is played 2-3 meters into the run</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> ball rebounds from the the heel of the pass receiver</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> pass receiver did not expect the pass</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
As passer it is your task to pay attention to the movements of your teammates and if they comply with the conditions for a x-pass (as stated above).
</p>

<p>
Only, if the pass receiver sticks to the rules, you are allowed to play a x-pass, in order to make sure that the pass is carried out successfully.
</p>

<p>
If there are multiple players available for a pass, you have to decide, which one will have the most options after receiving the ball.  <em>Is he able to initiate an attack? Does he have different passing options? Does he stand closer to the goal? </em>

<li class="level1"><div class="li">do not hold L2</div>

<li class="level1"><div class="li">only decide for runs into free space</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li">depending on the situation either you have to sprint (long way and plenty of space)</div>

</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li">never interrupt your run or change the direction</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you hold L2 or stand still, the through pass will not reach you. A through ball to a standing teammate will either be played unreachable into the run or directly into the foot, which is the same as a x-pass.
</p>

<p>
Ist die Laufrichtung nach einem Steilpass nicht frei, wird der Pass sehr wahrscheinlich abgefangen werden.
</p>

<p>
Ist der Passspieler nahe an dir dran und du sprintest mit voller Geschwindigkeit weg, ist die Abseitsgefahr sehr groß. Ist er jedoch weit weg von dir oder du musst noch weit in Richtung Lücke laufen, solltest du die Sprinttaste vergewaltigen bis der Arzt bzw. die Polizei kommt.
</p>

<p>
<strong>In a nutshell:</strong> <em>The closer you get to the pass receiver, the slower you have to run.</em>
</p>

<p>
Steilpässe verhalten sich jedoch in FIFA 15 oft willkürlich. Manchmal kann man so gut in eine Lücke gehen, wie man möchte, der Steilpass kommt oft einfach viel zu weit und genau in die Hände des Torhüters - daran kann man leider nichts ändern.

<p>
As stated above in the short pass section, as passer you have to make sure, that your teammates stick to the rules and requirements of a successfull pass. In addition you need to choose a proper pass dosage.

<div class="level2">

<p>
There are a lot of players who complain about insufficient involvement and criticise, that from their point of view they don&#039;t get enough passes.
Oftentimes there are discrepancies of ball contacts between the LCM and RCM. There are several reasons for this.

<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The far side of the camera gets neglected subconsciously. For example playing from left to right the game becomes automatically right-weighted.</div>
