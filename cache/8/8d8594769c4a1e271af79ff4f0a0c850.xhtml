<p>
By holding the L2 button you ensure that your player permanently keeps the viewing direction to the ball and at the same time to the passer. Hence, you attain four things:
</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> pass is not played in the back</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> pass is not played into the run</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> ball does not bounce in 99 percent of cases <sup><a href="#fn__1" id="fnt__1" class="fn_top">1)</a></sup></div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> you signal the player in possession, that you demand a x-pass</div>
</li>
</ol>

</p>

<p>
That is a crucial mistake of the vast majority of the FIFA community: It is <strong>not</strong> enough to run alongside the player in possession using the left stick - you move partially with the back to that player which results in a lower pass success rate.
When you want to receive a short x-pass and don&#039;t hold L2, you reduce the likelihood of an accurate pass.
</p>

<p>
Instead, it is more likely that one of the following four things happens:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> pass is played 2-3 meters in the back</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> pass is played 2-3 meters into the run</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> ball rebounds from the the heel of the pass receiver</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> pass receiver did not expect the pass</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
As passer it is your task to pay attention to the movements of your teammates and check wheather they comply with the conditions for a x-pass (as stated above).
</p>

<p>
Only, if the pass receiver sticks to the rules, you are allowed to play a x-pass, in order to make sure that the pass is carried out successfully.
</p>

<p>
If there are multiple players available for a pass, you have to decide, which one will have the most options after receiving the ball.  <em>Is he able to initiate an attack? Does he have different passing options? Does he stand closer to the goal? </em>

<li class="level1"><div class="li">do not hold L2</div>

<li class="level1"><div class="li">only decide for runs into free spaces</div>

<li class="level1"><div class="li">depending on the situation either you have to sprint (long way and plenty of space)</div>

</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li">never interrupt your run or change the direction</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you hold L2 or stand still, the through pass will not reach you. A through ball to a standing teammate will either be played unreachable into the empty space or directly into the foot, which is the same as a x-pass.
</p>

<p>
Always make sure that the direction you are running to is not occupied by an opposing player. The pass will very likely be intercepted.
</p>

<p>
If you are close to the passer reduce your speed, especially when your are near the offside line. If the distance is longer you should run with full speed.
</p>

<p>
<strong>In a nutshell:</strong> <em>The closer you get to the pass receiver, the slower you have to run.</em>
</p>

<p>
The accuracy of through balls depends on many factors (orientation of the player, left/right foot, ..).  Sometimes you can conduct a perfect run, but the ball ends in the hands of the goalkeeper.

<p>
As stated above in the short pass section, as passer you have to make sure, that your teammates stick to the rules and requirements of a successfull pass. In addition you need to choose a proper pass dosage.

<div class="level2">

<p>
There are a lot of players who complain about insufficient involvement and criticise, that from their point of view they don&#039;t get enough passes.
Oftentimes there are discrepancies of ball contacts between the LCM and RCM. There are several reasons for this.
