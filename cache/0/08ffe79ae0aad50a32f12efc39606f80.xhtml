<h2 class="sectionedit2" id="just_a_dummy">Just a Dummy?</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
Playing on the wing in Positional Play sounds too simple and extremely boring at first. There is actually only one side that you can play to compared to the complexity of the center and halfspaces.
</p>

<p>
To be more precise, the RW only has the left side to play to, since there is the sideline on the right. There is no “F” line, ofcourse. But it is not quite as easy as it sounds.
</p>

<p>
It is very easy to isolate wingers on the wing, which is a common way in defending. E.g. the LW gets the ball in A4 and the opponent&#039;s RW/RCM/RB attack him instantly. If the LW can&#039;t shield the ball or doesn&#039;t make a smart pass, he will most likely lose the ball.
</p>

<p>
This is one of the reasons, why the wings in Positional Play are called “Low priority zone” and LW/RW should very rarely get the ball before Line 5. The only effective thing they can do before line 5 without losing the ball or interrupting build-up play, is passing back directly. 
</p>

<p>
This doesn&#039;t help the team moving forward and is only raising the passes/touches statistics for that winger. And if he loses the ball unnecessarily, it shows even more, how redundant it is to pass to the wing in lines 1-4.
</p>

<p>
The only reason to pass to the wing there is by switches of play from e.g. B3 to E4.

</p>

<p>
Wingers seem alot more restricted to rules and don&#039;t have much to do - until the “Freedom zone”.
</p>

<p>
The “Freedom zone” is basically Line 5 and 6. There you have much more freedom in your dribblings and movements, by still keeping some kind of structure. Keeping the structure intact will always be very important e.g. to avoid teammates standing and running in each other&#039;s way or even “covering” each other.
</p>

<p>
This structure can easily be kept alive if LW limits his runs to B6 (sometimes B5) and RW to D6 (sometimes D5).
</p>

<p>
That freedom we are talking about rather refers to dribblings: The wingers are the only ones in attack who are allowed to (almost) constantly make feints, skill moves and sprints into the box (both with and without the ball).
</p>

<p>
I call the dribbling I will refer to “Halfspace-dribbling”. That means dribbling diagonally inside from A/E to B/D.
</p>

</div>

<p>
Example: Dribbling diagonally inside from E5 to D6 will give the RW following options, while green arrows are possible pass directions and black arrows are runs from teammates:
<a href="/lib/exe/detail.php?id=en%3Atactics%3Awinger&amp;media=en:tactics:rwhsd.png" class="media" title="en:tactics:rwhsd.png"><img src="/lib/exe/fetch.php?w=250&amp;tok=36d3c0&amp;media=en:tactics:rwhsd.png" class="mediaright" alt="" width="250" /></a>
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li">Short (L1+)X-pass to the RCM in D5, which could make a one-two possible to get behind defense</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li">Short (or “medium”) X-pass to LCM in C5, which makes other options possible</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li">Short through ball towards E6, if the RB is overlapping</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li">Long (lobbed) through ball towards B6 if LW is ready for it</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li">Short diagonal through ball towards C6 to assist the ST</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li">Or just finish yourself or dribble further inside the box and assist/finish there</div>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="clearer"></div>

<p>
One of these options will always work and it is your decision to choose the right option. There are more than enough to choose from. See the freedom now?
</p>

<p>
But the more your teammates are out of position and break the structure, options will be taken away from you. The same counts for you, too, ofcourse, so I hope you will see how important it is for us, that you as winger stay wide and don&#039;t interrupt the build-up until the freedom zone has been reached.

<p>
Messi uses quick one-twos in D5-6 while moving diagonally inside to get into the box. Requires one player in D5 to support him actively (always be an option after making a pass, always keep the same distance etc.). Iniesta provides a triangle in the end to finally get behind the last defender. 
</p>

<p>
The players taking part in the combination keep the ball between them and do not turn around with the ball and start dribbling or shoot selfishly: Iniesta could have also taken the ball and run towards the goal himself, although passing back to Messi would have been the better option.
</p>

<p>
This looks so incredibly easy and you would say “ofcourse! I would have done the same!” but it&#039;s mostly not the case. In reality, most players would break the combination and do something else.
</p>

<p>
Another example of using one-twos with the player in D5 to move into the middle with a through ball towards the goal in the end.

<p>
Moving from E5 to D5 by using a lateral one-two. After that, Messi sees that he is up against 3 defenders and passes the ball back to the pivot waiting in the back.

<p>
See how RB and RW switch positions while using one-twos to move further in D5, finishing with a pass to B5, where the LW is waiting.

</p>

<p>
Messi uses a halfspace-dribbling and then makes a lobbed through ball towards B6. Requires one player to be ready to start into B6 - this is one of the reasons why wingers <em>must</em> stay on their side, even if the ball is on the other side. Most players selfishly move towards the other side because they want to take part in combinations. Don&#039;t run towards the ball and wait for the ball to come to you instead.

Examples for dribbling further inside D6 as close to the goal as possible to assist/shoot in the end.

<h2 class="sectionedit9" id="final_words">Final Words</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
While the wingers positioning and behavior until line 4/5 is very restricted, there is virtually infinite freedom on the ball in the “freedom zone”. This freedom is still dependent on a structure, that must be kept to make that freedom on the ball possible.
</p>

<p>
Something that is very underestimated, is playing the ball (diagonally) towards the goal, i.e. the <em>center</em>. Getting from the wing towards the center always means moving through the halfspace by either passing or dribbling.
</p>

<p>
Most players however, rather move and pass towards the wing - away from the center/halfspace towards the sideline, which is more counter productive than getting closer to score. Watching the examples above, you will see that the primary movement of the ball and players are (diagonally) towards the center - not to the wing. 
</p>

<p>
In the end, we will <em>always</em> have to get the ball into the center because there is the goal. Every movement away from it does three things:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li">Process of chance creation gets slowed down/broken up</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li">Easier for the opponent to defend on the wing (remember: Low Priority Area; getting isolated)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li">(Opponent doesn&#039;t need to worry because) there is no pressure towards the goal</div>
</li>
