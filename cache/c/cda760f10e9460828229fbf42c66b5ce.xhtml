Move up as high as possible in the yellow areas to get the ball forward quicker and easier. You constantly have to find open space there to be available for passes. It is of utter importance, that you don&#039;t leave these zones especially during build-up. You must be available for passes to a higher line especially for the CB&#039;s and CDM (= verticalization) or we will rot in our half and have pointless possession. Also, if you are LCM for example and the ball is in E2-4 or D2-4, you mustn&#039;t leave B3-4! Instead, find space in B3-4 to be available for switches of play by either lobbed passes or R1-passes (“halfspace-switch”).
</p>

<p>
<strong>Light yellow (C3-4):</strong> This zone should mostly be avoided since it is already occupied by the CB/CDM. Too many players in this area and in the own half in particular can and will slow down build-up play and it will be hard to get the ball to higher areas.
</p>

<p>
<strong>High-priority-area A (Red, B5/D5):</strong> This is where the real party begins. If we control the ball there, we can create the most scoring chances.
</p>

<p>
<strong>High-priority-area B (Orange, C5)</strong> This is where one of the CM&#039;s can move into to overload to either stay in control or create danger by one-twos and triangle play with LCM/RCM/ST
</p>

<p>
<strong>Light blue (B6/C6/D6)</strong> This area is supposed to be penetrated by the playmaker for
finishing actions like one-twos or through balls. Don&#039;t forget that there is also a LW/RW and ST! If you constantly run into the box you may take away their freedom and force them to stay back/wide for you. You help your team and your attackers in particular the most by staying back in B5/D5 to cover them and/or be available for one-twos: There are many opportunities.

<h2 class="sectionedit3" id="what_are_the_​halfspaces_​">What are the &quot;​halfspaces&quot;?​</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
The vertical lines B2-5 and D2-5 are the so called “​halfspaces”​. They are called that way because they neither are the center nor the wings but rather ​half of both. 
</p>

<p>
A vital goal of positional play is to control the halfspaces and to create chances through them by one-twos and diagonal dribblings inside (for example from B5 to C5). 
</p>

<p>
Depending on the chosen system, there can be halfspace defenders (LCB/RCB), halfspace midfielders/​playmakers (LCM/RCM) and halfspace strikers (LS/RS). 
</p>

</div>
<!-- EDIT3 SECTION "What are the ​halfspaces?​" [2822-3374] -->
<h3 class="sectionedit4" id="passing_in_halfspaces">Passing in halfspaces</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Whilst the halfspace defenders (CB or CDM) try to pass the ball as far forward as possible from lower zones to higher ones (for example from B2 to D4), the halfspace playmaker has to circulate the ball safely in those higher zones by switching cleverly from one halfspace to the next. The goal is to get into the high-priority area, overload either B5, C5 or D5 and create danger patiently by both staying controlled and putting constant pressure on the opponent. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>There are three main types of passes CM&#039;s will make:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li">“​halfspace-switches”​ from B to D </div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li">back-passes to the pivot in C (who will probably switch the halfspace right after) </div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li">one-twos in the high-priority area </div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Other types of passes are:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li">through balls to ST/LW/RW (rather rare, since we mostly face very tight defenses) </div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li">safety passes to either E or A if there is really nothing else possible </div>
</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h3 class="sectionedit5" id="positional_play_is_not_tiki_taka">Positional Play is not Tiki Taka</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
To clarify it once again: The goal of Positional Play is to score goals and eventually win the game and not to gain as much possession as possible. Especially, if most of our possession is in lines 1-3!
</p>

<p>
It is very important for everyone ​to understand, that Positional Play IS NOT TIKI TAKA! Tiki Taka means passing around with one-touch passes, not making ​use of space and without ​creating chances. ​Do not make one-touch passes only because you want to play Tiki Taka. 
</p>

<p>
Pass with purpose! Use the space in front of you and carry the ball forward. Only pass when you can outplay an opponent. The more passes we have in lines 1-3, the less danger we can create and the higher chances are that we will lose instead!
</p>

<p>
Why?​ Because we will eventually make mistakes and a mistake in Line 1-3 means, that our opponent ​is already close to our goal without actually doing anything but waiting for us to mess up our pointless one-touch-tiki-taka-nonsense.
</p>

<p>
There are too many players who think they must leave their position to run whereever the ball is just to be there for direct back-passes. Don&#039;t run around like crazy because you want to play Tiki Taka. Stay in your zone/-s and move around in them (while holding L2) to be available for passes. Trust your teammates on the ball and they will bring it to you. Let them move the ball towards you, don&#039;t move yourself towards the ball too much.
</p>

<p>
There is only one time where Tiki Taka is useful: When we are winning ​and the game is almost over. But even then it only makes sense to play Tiki Taka as high as possible, preferably in lines 5-6.
</p>
<pre class="code">High ball possession rates ain&#039;t the goal of our play style, but the result of it!	</pre>

<h2 class="sectionedit6" id="signaling_through_balls">Signaling through balls</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
Especially when the ball is circulated for a longer time it is difficult for a striker to recognize, when and if a through ball will be played. For that reason the half-space playmakers and the striker have to agree on specific signals, in order to synchronize their actions. The following rule applies to all players:
</p>
<pre class="code">As soon as a playmaker (or winger)
starts to make a diagonal half-space dribbling,
it is high time for the striker to start his vertical run
and be prepared for a through ball.</pre>

<p>
<em>ELI5</em><sup><a href="#fn__1" id="fnt__1" class="fn_top">1)</a></sup>: <em>CM is dribbling → ST has to run.</em>
</p>

<p>
eg. Iniesta, Ribéry, Robben and Messi are well known for such half-space dribblings.
</p>

<p>
A “real” ST is exclusively there to be sent by through balls. He shouldn&#039;t be passed to with a x-pass in the own half. He will always run forward in order to open up spaces for the midfielders so they can make dribblings and combinations. The midfielders perform combiniations with the other midfielders in the half-spaces or the center rather than the striker! <sup><a href="#fn__2" id="fnt__2" class="fn_top">2)</a></sup>
</p>

</div>
<!-- EDIT6 SECTION "Signaling through balls" [6063-7209] -->
<h2 class="sectionedit7" id="half-space_dribbling">&quot;Half-space dribbling&quot;</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
As suggested before, the half-space should be leveraged through diagonal dribblings. <sup><a href="#fn__3" id="fnt__3" class="fn_top">3)</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
The following two figures illustrate the advantages of the inversity of the half-spaces over the center. Look at the field of vision and the pass options, when you glance towards the goal from the center. 
</p>

<p>
<a href="/lib/exe/detail.php?id=en%3Atactics%3Aplaymaking8&amp;media=de:tactics:passwinkelmoeglichkeiten-aus-dem-zentrum.png" class="media" title="de:tactics:passwinkelmoeglichkeiten-aus-dem-zentrum.png"><img src="/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=de:tactics:passwinkelmoeglichkeiten-aus-dem-zentrum.png" class="mediacenter" alt="" /></a><sup><a href="#fn__4" id="fnt__4" class="fn_top">4)</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
<em>Theoretically</em>, one could play in all directions from the center, what is visible in a 180° field of vision.
<em>Practically</em>, it looks somewhat different. If you want to play forward you are only able to play vertically or diagonally onto the wing. 
</p>

<p>
Defending the center is pretty simple due to its verticallity, for instance, by double marking. especially because most clubs play with two players on the six-position.
</p>

<p>
Now we want to talk about the advantages of the inverse field of vision in the half-spaces.
</p>

<p>
<a href="/lib/exe/detail.php?id=en%3Atactics%3Aplaymaking8&amp;media=de:tactics:passwinkelmoeglichkeiten-aus-dem-halbraum.png" class="media" title="de:tactics:passwinkelmoeglichkeiten-aus-dem-halbraum.png"><img src="/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=de:tactics:passwinkelmoeglichkeiten-aus-dem-halbraum.png" class="mediacenter" alt="" /></a>
<sup><a href="#fn__5" id="fnt__5" class="fn_top">5)</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Diagonal movements in the half-spaces enable chance creations more easily, because statistically every pass played towards the goal is very likely to become dangerous. A variety of opportunities arises from this position.
</p>

<p>
First of all the inverse movement enables the winger behind to overrun vertically. <sup><a href="#fn__6" id="fnt__6" class="fn_top">6)</a></sup>
Furthermore one can deliver the winger on the opposite side effectively<sup><a href="#fn__7" id="fnt__7" class="fn_top">7)</a></sup> with high or low passes.
Additionally one can switch the play if no through balls are possible.
Also, a one-two with a teammate in the center or the other half-space applicable.
</p>

<p>
Defenders preferably think and defend vertically or horizontally, That is why diagonal dribblings are so effective. They are constantly carried out by technically strong players such as Robben, Thiago or Messi.
These diagonal/inverse movements we call from now on “half-space dribbling”.
</p>

<p>
For instance, Robben performs these half-space dribblings several times a game, followed by a shot or a through ball. Iniesta preferrably looks for a one-two or a through ball, rather than a shot. Marco Reus is seemingly the best german half-space player and Leo Messi is the incarnation of the half-space god, who is able to perform every option in perfection (dribbling, one-two, through ball, finishing action).
</p>

<p>
Especially in Germany a lot of fans were wondering during Robbens first season at Bayern Munich: “Why can&#039;t you stop him, although he is always doing the same move?”.
</p>

<p>
Half-space dribblings are extremely hard to defend. And even if the defender is able to attack the half-space dribbler: he can simply pass back, pass onto an wing or make a more lateral movement, before getting attacked.
