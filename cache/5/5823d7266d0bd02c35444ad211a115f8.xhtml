<p>
<strong>Orange:</strong> When the attacking winger conducts an inverse dribbling into the halfspace, the wide making winger can and must move up into this space to get a through ball and possibly deliver a cross.

<p>
In a four-man defense the wingbacks are played by the left and right fullbacks. In a three-man defense it is usually the LM/RM.

<h2 class="sectionedit3" id="tasks">Tasks</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
The tasks of a wingback are relatively simple.
</p>

<p>
They play aggressively linear down their wing. The only time when thy move closer to the middle is when defending over a longer time (wide during possession, compact during defending).
</p>

<p>
A common paradox is, that wingbacks should actually be more aggressive and bolder than “classic” fullbacks. Be brave and trust your teammates. The CB&#039;s should be covering the space behind you in defense.
</p>

<p>
You are actually more attacking than defending.
</p>

</div>

<h4 id="touchline_magnet">Touchline magnet</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
During possession, you always stay wide and as high as possible. In attack, you should try to run behind the opponent&#039;s defense, while ensuring that the winger on your side is able to move inside towards the goal.
</p>

<p>
<strong>If you don&#039;t do this, the winger on your side has to stay wide instead and he can&#039;t be a threat to the opponent!</strong>
</p>

<p>
You should also look to create a triangle with the CM and winger. This little triangle can help tremendously to move further up or even create chances higher up.
</p>

<p>
Very important, too: If the ball is on the other side, you still have to be cautious and trying to be available for either switches of play or even long lobbed through balls from the back.
</p>

</div>

<h4 id="dribbling_and_passing">Dribbling and Passing</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
It&#039;s already been said that you play very linear. Your main task on the ball is basically moving up as far as possible with the ball and then pass it short either to the winger (lower priority) or the CM (higher priority).
</p>

<p>
The closer you are to your teammates the quicker your decisions have to be. Once in the opponent&#039;s half, you play a lot of direct passes in your triangle. 
</p>

<p>
Try to avoid diagonal X-passes forward, because they are rather slow and can be easily intercepted, rather pass backwards diagonally (mostly CM or CDM) or forward linearly (winger).
</p>

<p>
<strong>Example failed diagonal pass forward:</strong>

</p>

<p>
You should play through balls and long balls of all kinds rather rarely, they should be done from the center instead.

Both wingbacks here should be higher, then the wingers can move towards the goal.
</p>

<p>
<a href="/lib/exe/detail.php?id=en%3Atactics%3Awingback&amp;media=en:tactics:uu.jpg" class="media" title="en:tactics:uu.jpg"><img src="/lib/exe/fetch.php?w=600&amp;tok=c6e3b6&amp;media=en:tactics:uu.jpg" class="mediacenter" alt="" width="600" /></a>
The RB should be much higher and wider here, the current positioning is pointless.
</p>

<p>
<a href="/lib/exe/detail.php?id=en%3Atactics%3Awingback&amp;media=en:tactics:tt.jpg" class="media" title="en:tactics:tt.jpg"><img src="/lib/exe/fetch.php?w=600&amp;tok=3a4ed2&amp;media=en:tactics:tt.jpg" class="mediacenter" alt="" width="600" /></a>
Here we are playing 6 vs 2 in our half, which is pointless. There&#039;s no reason for the LB to stay so far back. There is nothing that must be defended there.
</p>

<p>
<a href="/lib/exe/detail.php?id=en%3Atactics%3Awingback&amp;media=en:tactics:pp.jpg" class="media" title="en:tactics:pp.jpg"><img src="/lib/exe/fetch.php?w=600&amp;tok=feff20&amp;media=en:tactics:pp.jpg" class="mediacenter" alt="" width="600" /></a>
If we can manage to get the ball to the LW, LB can break through on the left wing without problem. All he has to do is stand higher up front. Same accounts to the RB, which can be seen on the radar.
</p>

<p>
<a href="/lib/exe/detail.php?id=en%3Atactics%3Awingback&amp;media=en:tactics:oo.jpg" class="media" title="en:tactics:oo.jpg"><img src="/lib/exe/fetch.php?w=600&amp;tok=badf56&amp;media=en:tactics:oo.jpg" class="mediacenter" alt="" width="600" /></a>
</p>

<p>
Similar situation. Our LW has to move further back because LB is too  defensive. This makes it harder for us to get out of our own half.
</p>

<p>
But more problematic is the RB&#039;s positioning here, as you can see on the radar: There is no opponent anywhere near him. There is no reason for him to stay back so much.
</p>

<p>
<a href="/lib/exe/detail.php?id=en%3Atactics%3Awingback&amp;media=en:tactics:ll.jpg" class="media" title="en:tactics:ll.jpg"><img src="/lib/exe/fetch.php?w=600&amp;tok=6cfa45&amp;media=en:tactics:ll.jpg" class="mediacenter" alt="" width="600" /></a>
</p>

<p>
The LB mustn&#039;t even have the ball in this situation and should already be up to the halfway line. Right side also very problematic again.
</p>

<p>
<a href="/lib/exe/detail.php?id=en%3Atactics%3Awingback&amp;media=en:tactics:kk.jpg" class="media" title="en:tactics:kk.jpg"><img src="/lib/exe/fetch.php?w=600&amp;tok=25a0d4&amp;media=en:tactics:kk.jpg" class="mediacenter" alt="" width="600" /></a>
</p>

<p>
Not as crucial here as in the other examples since green would have a free way to the goal, but it shows how much space an attacking wingback would have if he used it.
</p>

<p>
<a href="/lib/exe/detail.php?id=en%3Atactics%3Awingback&amp;media=en:tactics:jj.jpg" class="media" title="en:tactics:jj.jpg"><img src="/lib/exe/fetch.php?w=600&amp;tok=174c22&amp;media=en:tactics:jj.jpg" class="mediacenter" alt="" width="600" /></a>
</p>

<p>
LB could make another breakthrough on the left wing. And look at the radar: RB is standing on the same position as the RCB, that&#039;s pointless!
</p>

<p>
<a href="/lib/exe/detail.php?id=en%3Atactics%3Awingback&amp;media=en:tactics:ii.jpg" class="media" title="en:tactics:ii.jpg"><img src="/lib/exe/fetch.php?w=600&amp;tok=97f2f5&amp;media=en:tactics:ii.jpg" class="mediacenter" alt="" width="600" /></a>
</p>

<p>
Last example.
